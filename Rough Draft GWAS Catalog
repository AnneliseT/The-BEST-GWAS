This is a base idea for how the code will search the downloaded GWAS Catalog for a SNP in the previously generated SNP list
Feel free to change it as you see fit

Finder(SNPname)
---------------------
A=[]
open(filename.txt,'r') as tsv ##read the GWAS cataolg as an array of arrays
for line in tsv:
  B=line.strip().split('\t')
  A.append(B)

SNPData=[]
for x in A:
  if x[27] == SNPname: ##The SNP name is the 28th column in the GWAS catalog, but this is subject to change
    SNPData =x

if SNPData==[]:
  print "SNP Not Found"
return SNPData
