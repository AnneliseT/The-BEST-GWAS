This is a base idea for how the code will search the downloaded GWAS Catalog for a SNP in the previously generated SNP list
Feel free to change it as you see fit

Finder(SNPnameList)
---------------------
A=[]
open(filename.txt,'r') as tsv ##read the GWAS cataolg as an array of arrays
for line in tsv:
  B=line.strip().split('\t')
  A.append(B)

for SNPname in SNPnameList
  SNPname=SNPname.strip()
  SNPData=[]
  for x in A:
    if x[21] == SNPname: ##The SNP name is the 22nd column in the GWAS catalog, but this is subject to change
      SNPData =x

  if SNPData==[]:
    print SNPname + " Not Found"
  else:
    file.writeline(SNPData)
return SNPData
