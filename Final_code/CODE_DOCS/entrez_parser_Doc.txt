Purpose of Script:
	The purpose of this script is to pull SNP information from NCBI's dbSNP using the Entrez library.

Information Categories:
	There are several categories that are returned using the Entrez function efetch(), however we are only
	using a subset of these categories, specifically: rsID, organism, Gene, Gene_ID, Accession number,
	Chromosome, Function Class, SNP ID, Choromosome Base Position, and Contig Position.

Functions:
	SNP_data:
		The SNP_data function takes in an rsID and searches the dbSNP database using that rsID as 
		a parameter. The function implements the efetch() function using the Entrez library and 
		returns a text file containing the information for the SNP associated with the given rsID.
		Variables are intialized for the information categories that are being pulled from. A 
		dictionary object is then created for the data that has been retrieved for the SNP. 

Main:
	In main a list of rsIDs is iterated trough and the SNP_data function is run using each rsID as a 
	parameter. A list of SNP dictionary objects, called SNP_COLLECTION, is then created from the 
	SNP_data function's outputs. Currently main prints the contents of each SNP dictionary object in
	SNP_COLLECTION list. In the future this information will most likely be put into an output file 
	that the user can download.
